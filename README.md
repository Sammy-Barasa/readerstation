# readerstation
This was a project inspired by cs50's bookreview project(https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/web/projects/1/project1.html). I have done it in python, Flask.
Users can log in and search for books, get the book description, add a review and post it.
Most of the book information is obtained from https://www.goodreads.com/api
